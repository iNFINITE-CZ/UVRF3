# UVRF3 - Interaction toolkit
XR interaction plugin that allows rapid development and deployment of XR projects using Unreal Engine 5. Except we’re not there yet!

At this point UVRF3 is early in development and we would say it’s nowhere near useful, even though several internal projects prove otherwise. Refactors still happen quite frequently and they often break things, so please don’t use it (yet).

The reason we’ve published it this early is to allow people to take a look at our implementation of things - and feel free to copy it into your projects.
